## Overview

I coded this page based only on the FIGMA file, so I used precise "width" and "height" values ​​in order to obtain a result exact to that of the FIGMA file, which is not not recommended. 

If I had to do it again I would try to get an exact result without having to restrict my "width", "height" and others with static values.
